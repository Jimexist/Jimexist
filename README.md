### Hi there 👋

I'm Jiayu Liu, currently the head of platform engineering in [Airbnb China](https://www.airbnb.cn/), where my day job is tech management. If you are interested in joining us, please take a look at https://careers.airbnb.com/. I also maintain a personal website at https://www.jiayu.me/.

Beside work, my current interests include:
- 🤖️ machine learning and AI (I used to do Kaggle but not any more) 
- 🔢 data and analytics infra (I used to do a start-up, also I'm a contributor to Apache [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) and [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion))
- 🚗 autonomous driving :-)
